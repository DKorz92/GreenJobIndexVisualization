    <h2>Choose a MSA</h2>

    <p>
        First, you have to choose a MSA of interest. You can click on the field in the map or search for the name in the field on the left and click on the it.</br>
        For this documentation we are going to check the situation for Boise City.
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis: What's the actual situation?</h2>
    <img src="static/docuImages/step2_msaPanel_boiseSelected.PNG">
    <p>
        After selecting your city of interest, you can compare the MSA with his neighbors in the green index ranking. For the following analysis we add Evansville to our selection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another tool to investigate the situation of a MSA is the Over-Time-Panel. Here you can see the development of the green index of all selected MSAs.
    </p>

    <h2>Choose a set of occupations</h2>
    <img src="static/docuImages/step3_osPanel.PNG">
    <p>
        The Occupation-Space-Panel gives you an overview over the specialiced green and non-green occupations, visualiced with an filled point.</br>
        It's clear to see, that Boise and Evansville have the quite same number of specialiced green occupation. Houston has a much better specialication, whereas Madera has a very low number of specialiced occupations.
    </p>
    <img src="static/docuImages/step3_ogPanel.PNG">
    <p>
        To decide, which occupation you want to specialice in your MSA, the Occupation-Graph-Panel gives you two main criterias: First the direct increase of the green index and second the estimated easiness of specialication.<br>
        Next to this, the sallary of each occupation is shown by circle radius and color: The bigger (bluer) the circle, the higher the salary. Therefore you can choose between the salary in the MSA, the USA or the relative value (MSA/USA).</br>
        A grey-drawn circle means, that for this occupation are no data stored in the database.
    </p>
    <img src="static/docuImages/step3_ogPanel_2selected.PNG">
    <p>
        For this consideration we select the two occupations "Solar Photovoltaic Installers" and "Wind Turbin Service Technicans", which are potentialy hard to specialice but have a high increase of the green index.
    </p>
    <h2>Choose a set of industries</h2>
    <p>
        Next we have to choose a set of industries, with wich we want to attracte workers in the selected occupations. The graphs show the percentage amount of workers of each occupation in the single industries.
    </p>
    <img src="static/docuImages/step4_indPanel.PNG">
    <p>
        Most of the industries just occupy one sort of workers, but if we invest in self-employed workers or the "Power and communication line ..."-industry we get both sorts. Which to choose? </br>
        A usefull tool could be the 10-year-projection.
    </p>
    <img src="static/docuImages/step4_indPanel_10year.PNG">
    <p>
        Here we can see, that the self-employed workers will loose influence in our selected occupations, whereas the other industry will gain influence. So to invest in the last one could be sensefull.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview and create a new layer</h2>
    <img src="static/docuImages/step5_layerPanel.PNG">
    <p>
        Now we have a rough idea how to continue. The last panel concludes you the done selection and offers you the possibility to create a new "What-If-Scenario".</br>
        With a click on one of the selected MSAs the server calculates the minimal number of workers for each selected industry, which have to attracte, to specialice the selected occupations.
    </p>

    <h2>And now...?</h2>
    <p>
        A missing function is, that you can investigate now the MSA under the new circumstances.
